# hophacks_carpool
This is a carpooling app called "SFNC CARPOOL" for the community in Baltimore, to mainly serve the transportation needs of students. It aims to provide updates and notifications for transportation for children to school and co-curricular activities and events. It also allows the community to keep track of the movement of children in general, and create networks of families and children with similar interests, while providing safe transportation for them.
